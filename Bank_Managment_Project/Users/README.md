### Users Folder:

# The Users folder is a crucial directory within the bank management system that contains individual files for each registered user of the application. Each user's file appears to be named after their username with a .txt extension.

    User Files: Each user's file stores essential details about their account:
        Password: Encrypted/Unencrypted (based on the code you've shown, it's unencrypted, which is a security concern in a real-world application) password for the user to access their account.
        Phone Number: Contact detail associated with the user account.
        Balance: Numeric representation of the amount of money the user currently has in their account.

    Log Files: Alongside the primary user files, there are log files which keep track of specific activities related to that user. These files log crucial events like:
        Password changes
        Phone number updates
        Balance modifications
        Username changes

    The naming convention seems to append _logs to the username, indicating that the file contains log details of that specific user.

    File Structure: The internal structure of these files appears to be a straightforward text format where each line represents a different piece of user information or a specific log entry.

In summary, the Users folder serves as a database of sorts for the bank management system. It organizes user-specific data in individual files, making it easier to manage and access. However, in a real-world application, one would typically use a proper database management system for better scalability, security, and efficiency.
