a small project of an ATM where the user will have to login first and then get access to their acc, there are 6 options; 

1_balance. 2_deposit. 3_get help. 4_withdraw. 5_acc info. 6_quit.

1_for the balancef function, i created a file where the bal value gets stored for future usage.

2_for the deposit function, i created a file where the depo value gets stored to be added to the bal's value and gets assigned a value of 0 after so it won't affect the bal value in the future.( bal -= depo )

3_for the get help option, it's just a guide for the user to understand the purpose of each option on the menu.

4_for the withdraw function, i created a file to store withdraw value so we can substract it from the balance and gets assigned the value 0 after.

5_acc info is where the user can get their personal information such as acc name/acc bal/last activities/acc creation date.

6_for the user to stop the progeram and quit.

I hope that I was helpfulðŸ’–.
